This is a test module to load images from flickr based on a search term entered in the field at the top of the page. 

I have built this very  much as a prototype: the styling is minimally based upon the design provided. It is intended to be responsive (up to a point) but there would be much more I would do to make it fully so.

I began by creating a minimal page to hold the displayed assets (index.html). 

Upon submitting the search form an Ajax request is made to the flickr API and a JSON Object is returned representing the first (in this case) 15 images and the pagination data associated with those.

All the thumbnails are displayed for those images and the first of those is displayed as a large image.  

The pagination controls cause another set of 15 images to be loaded and displayed likewise. 

I have not yet added the functionality to move through the main images contained on the page in a carousel style but this does function by selecting a thumbnail. 

I decided to display the pagination by showing the current page number and the total number of pages, in between the controls to go back/forward one image and to the first/last images. 
This is in order to reduce the complexity where there are a large number of images returned by that search term.

I decided to display the main image at an explicit size and 'mask out' the excess areas.
This keeps a constant layout across all different image sizes. 

I began to put in some CSS3 transitions.

I have not yet optimised the images sizes.
